&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring is a wonderful time of the year. The buds swell in spring, it becomes warmer after the cold winters, blossom favorite flowers are snowdrops. All plants begin life.     </p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmuring streams, on the roofs of houses dripping drops. The sun is shining brighter and brighter. Snow melts, grass turns green, birds fly from the South. Spring can be warm, sometimes cold.</p><p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this spring will be warm and Sunny. Nature comes to life in this wonderful time of year. And after spring comes summer.
